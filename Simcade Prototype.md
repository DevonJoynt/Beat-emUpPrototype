# Digital Prototype Development - Fire Game
## Overview 
You are a pirate ship in the middle of the ocean sailing around islands and defending yourself from other ships.

### What is our Mechanic
Your ship, a small ship in the middle of the ocean, has enemy ships surrounding it where they come in waves/rounds and attacking. When you beat one wave, the next wave will come in, but the attack is even harder. 

If you survive the attack of two (2) waves of ships, you will receive an extra life or full health. 

Points counter for when you destroy enemy ships 

You control the ship (Ship is the player). You are not controlling a player on the ship. 

### Design Objective Statement
The idea is to have 2 players travel through a short maze to meet up or connect with each other before the game is over.​
You go into different levels with each successive pass​
Eventually the time will run out and how many levels you completed in 60 sec will be your score​
To get through the maze you must solve mini puzzles (ie: opening a door or breaking a wall)​

What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design?​
Emotional goals –Fulfillment, Connection,​
Gameplay goals-Fast paced, Intuitive​

Why?​
We want our game to be engaging and grab our players attention while still remaining in the 60 second time limit. By having levels to complete within the timer, it gives replay value to the game inspiring the player to retry and beat their last record. We will have the levels randomly generate each time as well to add more randomness to the game.​

### Metric Research and References
Physics elements:  

Cannon - (A cannon mounted on a pirate ship fires a cannonball at 125 m/s horizontally, at a height of 17.5 m above the ocean surface.

Metric force Units - measured in newtons (N), defined as the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass by 1 meter per second squared (1 N = 1 kg·m/s²).
